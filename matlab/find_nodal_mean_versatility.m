% find_nodal_mean_versatility will find the versatility across a
% spectrum of parameters, and then take the average.  This has been
% shown to be more stable than versatility at any given gamma.  `g` is
% an NxN adjacency matrix, which can either be weighted or unweighted,
% directed or undirected.  `f` should be a function that takes an
% adjacency matrix as its first argument and a resolution parameter as
% its input(s) and returns a 1xN community affiliation matrix (i.e. a
% vector where each node is associated with an identifier, and nodes
% with the same identifier are in the same community).  The argument
% is `ar`, which should be the values of the resolution parameter over
% which to take the average.  The next optional argument is `it`,
% which is the number of iterations over which to calculate the
% versatility AT EACH GAMMA; the defualt of 100 seems to be good,
% though I haven't done any systematic investigations into this.  The
% last optional argument is `processors`, which should be 1 if you
% would like to use parallelization.
% 
% Example usage:
%
%     % Louvain versatility from .4 to 2.5
%     find_nodal_mean_versatility(G)
%     % Louvain versatility from .4 to 2.5, run on 3 processors
%     find_nodal_mean_versatility(G, [], [], [], 3)
%     % Louvain versatility for weighted networks from .5 to 2.0, using 200 iterations per gamma
%     find_nodal_mean_versatility(G, @modularity_louvain_dir, .5:.05:2.0, 200)
